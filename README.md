**Brook** is a linkboard heavily inspired by HN. It runs on Node.JS and MongoDB.

Written with both code brevity and page speed in mind, so beware the basic scripting in the frontend.

The ranking algorithm is based on Ken Shirrif's [findings](http://www.righto.com/2013/11/how-hacker-news-ranking-really-works.html) [(and here)](http://www.righto.com/2009/06/how-does-newsyc-ranking-work.html) on his research about YCombinator's Hacker News ranking.

The app does not cover the following yet, but I plan to add them in soon.

**0. User Functions**, <strike>notifications, listing submissions and comments,</strike> basic karma (non formulaic), banning

**1. Filters**, like "New", "Show", or "Ask". Based on user input or moderation.

**2. Channels**, much like subreddits, except more streamlined.

**2.a. Channel exclusive filters**

**3. Moderation UI**, may it be terminal based or web. Currently moderation can only be done directly to the database. This may be an entirely separate project.

**3.a. User roles**

**4 Search**, though I am not sure if this is something I want, keyword indexing is expensive

#### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
```

#### Moderation

Refer to `config.js` for flags.

Push corresponding strings to Post.flags[] to moderate posts.

#### Demo

Soon. I plan to actually run it more than as a demo.

#### Screenshots

Very soon.
